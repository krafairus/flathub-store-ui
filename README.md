Web Version of Flathub (Installable)

This allows you to install packages from Flathub with just a click on the install button—no need to download the file and install it manually. Just a few clicks, and no leftover files. It works on Deepin OS, Debian, and Ubuntu. For other distributions or non-Debian-based systems, I do not provide support, and you should not expect a response—though porting it to other packages would be easy.

Note: This is not an official package from Flatpak or Flathub. It can be considered an unofficial program to access Flathub in a more desktop-integrated way.

Currently available only for Debian-based distributions.
The package for Arch/Manjaro will be available soon.

# Future Features:

(In progress) Translations will be fully implemented very soon. Although translation loading is already set up, I plan to improve the process so translations can be added automatically instead of gradually translating the entire program.

(Features) New features will be added to further integrate Flatpak options graphically.

(Package) I will create a Flatpak package and upload it to Flathub to make it more accessible across other distributions.
