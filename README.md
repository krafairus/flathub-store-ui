# Flathub Store UI

![imagen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8755a08-ec10-47e2-b9e2-7dfb48e416d3)

Installable web version of Flathub that allows you to install packages from Flathub by simply clicking the install button, without having to download the file and install it manually. It only takes a few clicks and no hassle. It works on Deepin OS, Debian, and Ubuntu. I don't provide support for those distros or based on these, and I don't expect a response, although it would be easy to port it to other packages.

This is not an official package from Flatpak or Flathub. It can be considered an unofficial program to access Flathub in a more integrated way with the desktop.

Now available only for Debian-based distributions.
The Arch/Manjaro package will be available soon.

## Future options:

(in progress) I will soon finish implementing the translations. Although the loading of translations and other tools has already been implemented, I plan to improve the process so that I don't have to translate the entire program bit by bit, and that it is done automatically.

(Features) I will add new features to further integrate Flatpak options graphically.

(Package) Create a Flatpak package and upload it to Flathub to make it more accessible from other distributions.
